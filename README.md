# ACCESSIBLE MODAL DIALOG

An accessible modal dialog demo. This ensures that when the modal dialog box is opened, one cannot interact with other contents outside the modal dialog.

## DEMOS

### BEFORE

When the modal dialog is open, one can tab through other contents outside the modal using the **TAB** key which is not the desired outcome.

### AFTER

Now, other contents outside the modal cannot be accessed when using the **TAB** key. When the modal dialog is opened, it stays in focus. To close the modal dialog, one can click on the **close** button, press on the **esc** key or click outside the modal.
